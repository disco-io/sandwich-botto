sandwich botto is the first Discord bot I made for fun over the summer of 2022. Its purpose is to randomly generate sandwiches for users (like me) who don't know what to have for lunch... :) 

Here is a list of things the bot can do right now!
 
       ü•™ >sandwich build your own sandwich using a variety of randomly generated ingredients. 
       üîÄ >random randomly generate a sandwich of all types of ingredients. 
       üç≠ >sweet are you an enjoyer of sweet sandwiches? i'll show you some popular recipes 
       üçû >breadlist my database of breads. 
       ü•© >meatlist my database of meats. 
       üßÄ >cheeselist my database of cheeses. 
       üçÖ >spreadlist my database list of spreads. 
       ü•¨ >veggielist my database of veggies.
